# Simple ML models experiment tracking with diff. models using MLOps tool (MLFLOW).

## Project Goal :

To showcase the power of MLOps tool in Machine Learning project life cycle, the tool which is use in this project is (**MLFlow**) software which help to streamline and automate the ML lifecycle such as :

--> Experiment Tracking

  1. Logging Metrics and Parameters
  2. Reproducibility

--> Project Packaging

  1. MLFlow Projects
  2. Dependency Management

--> Model Management and Registry

  1. Model Packaging
  2. Model Registry

--> Deployment Automation

  1. Serving Models
  2. Integration with CI/CD Pipelines

--> Collaboration and Transparency

  1. Centralized Experiment Log
  2. Auditing and Versioning

## Library which is requied :

    mlflow
    numpy
    scikit-learn
    pandas
    xgboost
    imbalanced-learn

## Output tracking :

## Summary :

In summary, MLFlow acts as the backbone of many MLOps projects by providing the infrastructure needed for:

1. Tracking experiments and ensuring reproducibility.
2. Packaging projects and managing dependencies.
3. Registering, versioning, and deploying models.
4. Integrating seamlessly with automated pipelines for continuous integration and deployment.

This integration of MLFlow into an MLOps pipeline not only enhances collaboration among teams but also ensures that every step from experimentation to deployment is well-documented and reproducible, ultimately accelerating the model development lifecycle.
